# Dns-tunneling-attack-detection
DNS tunneling is a method used by attackers to steal sensitive information by encrypting them as DNS queries. In this project I try to learn to build an ML model that detects tunneling attacks amidst the regular DNS traffic. 
# Methods I'll be using are LSTM-Long short term memory and Autoencoders.
